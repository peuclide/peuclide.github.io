# __Peter Euclide, Ph.D.__

I am a research scientist and Illinois-Indiana Sea Great Fisheries Specialist working at Purdue University. My research uses combination of modern genomic techniques and ecology to answer questions related to animal movement and local adaptation that inform management and conservation. My current research centers around the use of whole genome and reduced representation sequencing to develop GT-seq and Rapture panels to study fish evolution and population structure in the Great Lakes. However, I have had the opportunity to work on all sorts of other projects such as:

* Environmental DNA metabarcoding
* [Public outreach and science communication](https://peuclide.github.io/ed_and_out.html)
* <a href="https://peuclide.github.io/Research#mysis">Mysis</a>
* <a href="https://peuclide.github.io/Research#fish_race">Racing fish</a>
* <a href="https://peuclide.github.io/Research#apps_and_dat">RShiny</a>

My research career began in college at Kent State University in Ohio where I worked in two very different labs, one studying community ecology of stream leaf packs and the other studying the population genetics of _Lobelia siphilitica_. After completing my B.S. in organismal biology, I moved to the University of Vermont and earned a M.Sc. in Natural Resources  studying the diel vertical migration behavior of _Mysis diluviana_ in Lake Champlain before changing departments and earning a Ph.D. in Biology studying the impact of habitat fragmentation on five different species of fish.
