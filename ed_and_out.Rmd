One of the most important steps in research is the dissemination of knowledge and results to a wide audience. I enjoy working collaboratively with educators and the public to explain my own research and show people that science is accessible to everyone.

#__ECHO Science Translation Fellowship__
***

in 2013 I worked with the [ECHO Lake Aquarium and Science Center](http://www.echovermont.org/) for a year as the science-education fellow to create a symbiotic relationship between ECHO and the [Rubenstein Ecosystem Science Laboratory](http://www.uvm.edu/~ecolab/). The goal of my fellowship was to facilitate a relationship where ECHO can benefit from the knowledge and expertise of RSENR researchers while we can benefit from the educational expertise and outreach capacity of ECHO.
