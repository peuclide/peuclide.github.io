One of the most important steps in research is the dissemination of knowledge and results to a wide audience. I enjoy working collaboratively with educators and the public to explain my own research and show people that science is accessible to everyone.

# R-expo coding workshop
***

The R-expo is a easy alternative to a full R workshop and helps to teach both both basic and advanced coding in R. Participants engage with R experts in different topics in a casual, open space and partake in short, 5 â€“ 10 minute vignettes that focus on a particular R skill or package (e.g. plotting in ggplot, spatial data analysis, building functions and loops). In this setting, presenters in various fields can teach simultaneously, similar to a poster session,allowing participants to engage in topics that they are interested in and learn at their own pace.

# ECHO Science Translation Fellowship
***

In 2013 I worked with the [ECHO Lake Aquarium and Science Center](http://www.echovermont.org/) for a year as the science-education fellow to create a symbiotic relationship between ECHO and the [Rubenstein Ecosystem Science Laboratory](http://www.uvm.edu/~ecolab/). The goal of my fellowship was to facilitate a relationship where ECHO can benefit from the knowledge and expertise of RSENR researchers while we can benefit from the educational expertise and outreach capacity of ECHO.
